# RPI Generative Logo

A generative visual identity system for Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute that embodies the concept of measurement itself as a design tool. Rather than a static logo, this creates infinite variations of the RPI wordmark where the bottom bar transforms into live visualizations of data, patterns, and metrics.

## Core Concept
Imagine a school so pragmatic, the visual identity system itself becomes a tool for measurement and discovery. True to RPI's ethos, this isn't just another logo—it's a flexible system that symbolizes the multitude of dimensions, domains, and real-world contexts of RPI's research and education impact.

The world we measure: Music (scales, frequencies), Color (wavelengths, spectrums), Distance (nanometers to light-years), Volume (acoustics), Location (coordinates), Speed (milliseconds to centuries), Temperature (Kelvin, thermal), Pressure (atmospheric), Weight (molecular mass), Light (lumens, aperture), Power (watts, torque), Hardness (tensile strength), Energy (joules, kinetic), Academics (grades, rankings).

## Generative Nature
This logo system generates rather than displays. Each configuration is:

- **Parametrically driven** - Adjustable width, scale, and pattern density
- **Data responsive** - Binary text encoding, measurement scales, mathematical ratios
- **Infinitely variable** - No two outputs need be identical
- **Context adaptive** - Different modes for different applications
- **Real-time** - Live parameter adjustment with immediate visual feedback

## Tech Stack
Vanilla JavaScript, WebGL (GLSL shaders), Web Audio API (AudioWorklet)

## Local Development
Serve with any static web server: `python3 -m http.server` or `npx serve`
