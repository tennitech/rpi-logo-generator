# RPI Logo Generator - Project Status & Master Documentation

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-12
**Current Phase:** Phase 3 (Advanced Features & Refinement)

## 1. Project Overview
A web-based **Design Tool** integrated with RPI's central Brand Hub. It allows students and faculty to generate unique, brand-compliant RPI "Bar" logos and lockups. The tool strictly adheres to branding patterns while ensuring safety and stability.

## 2. Architecture & Tech Stack
*   **Core:** Vanilla HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+).
*   **Rendering:** p5.js (WebGL mode) for 2D/3D graphics and shaders.
*   **Integration:** Designed to embed within the **Frontify** ecosystem.
*   **Shaders:** GLSL fragment shaders for pattern generation.
*   **Audio:** Web Audio API with AudioWorklet (`pulse-worklet.js`) for audio-reactive features.
*   **Fonts:** Official `RPIGeist` family (WOFF2) served locally.

### File Structure
*   `assets/` - Static resources (fonts, images, shaders).
*   `css/` - Stylesheets (`style.css`).
*   `js/` - Logic (`main.js`, `drawing.js`, `pulse-worklet.js`).
    *   `utils/` - Helper modules (`profanityFilter.js`).
*   `references/` - Documentation and guidelines.

## 3. Completed Milestones

### Phase 0: Analysis & Setup
*   [x] Analyzed Project Proposal and Brand Guidelines.
*   [x] Extracted condensed brand rules for agent usage.

### Phase 1: Foundation & Safety
*   [x] **Structure:** specific directory layout established (`assets`, `css`, `js`).
*   [x] **Branding:** Integrated `RPIGeist` font family and defined CSS variables.
*   [x] **Safety:** Implemented client-side profanity filter with real-time feedback.
*   [x] **UI Polish:** Shifted to workspace layout, implemented accessible dropdowns and navigation.

### Phase 2: Stability & Integration
*   [x] **Frontify Integration:** Researched strategy (iframe/embed) and implemented "Copy Embed Code" feature.
*   [x] **Generator Stability:** Fixed WebGL context handling, memory leaks, and added unit tests (Jest).
*   [x] **UX Perfection:** Refined download workflow with Toast notifications and polished controls.
*   [x] **Asset Lockdown:** Verified adherence to hardcoded brand constants.

## 4. Active Roadmap

### Phase 3: Advanced Features & Refinement
*   [ ] **Advanced Export:** High-res PNG/SVG export refinement.
*   [ ] **Interactive Tutorials:** Guide users through the tool.
*   [ ] **Club Pilot:** Beta launch for student clubs.
*   [ ] **AI Exploration:** (Future) Event-specific background generation.

## 5. Recent Updates
- **[2026-02-12] Phase 2 Completed**:
    - Implemented Toast notification system for better UX.
    - Added "Copy Embed Code" feature for Frontify integration.
    - Fixed WebGL context handling and memory leaks.
    - Set up Jest testing framework.
    - Created Frontify integration strategy document.

## 6. Design Decisions
*   **Profanity Filter:** Implemented client-side for immediate feedback and user privacy.
*   **Font Format:** Chosen `.woff2` for optimal web performance.
*   **Global Access:** `ProfanityFilter` attached to `window` for p5.js compatibility.
*   **Frontify Integration:** Chosen external iframe embedding as the initial integration strategy for simplicity and speed.

## 7. Known Issues / Notes
*   `main.js` relies heavily on global variables (p5.js pattern). Future refactoring might consider modularizing this.
