# About Our Brand

## Overview

Our brand encompasses the characteristics, beliefs, and standards that shape our identity and distinguish us from other institutions. Along with our students, faculty, staff, facilities, and alumni network, our brand is a competitive advantage that extends beyond visual elements to include our messaging and communication style.

Consistent application of our brand helps establish credibility with all our audiences and allows RPI's authentic differentiators and advantages to shine. It elevates and bolsters a culture built on our storied two-century history of innovation and excellence.

## Our Dynamic, Generative Identity

Various technical tools and visual patterns surround a surveyor's rod in the very center.

RPI’s new visual identity is not just a brand guideline — it’s a mindset. It’s an invitation to every student, faculty, and staff member to experiment. It’s an invitation to define success on RPI’s own terms. It asks a fundamental question that sits at the heart of invention: “What if we tried this?”

Our visual identity is a dynamic tool. It does more than claim value; it inspires the community to create it. It draws inspiration from a versatile system of metrics that symbolize the multitude of dimensions, domains, and real-world contexts of RPI’s research and education impact.

These are the four key design principles that define our identity:

### Dynamic

The identity adapts to different contexts while maintaining coherence.

### Participatory

It invites the community to contribute and co-create.

### Authentic

It accurately reflects our culture of experimentation and discovery.

### Distinctive

It sets RPI apart in a landscape of institutional sameness.

# Who We Are

## Section Overview

This section captures the essence of who we are as an institution — our driving purpose, our community, and the values that guide everything we do.

## Our Purpose and Vision

### Who We Are

Founded in 1824, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) is the first technological research university in the United States. We bring creativity, science, and technology together to address society’s greatest challenges.

### Our Purpose

We cultivate exceptional problem-solvers by immersing them in a culture of rigorous inquiry, disciplined practice, and hands-on application. Our strategic plan, RPI Forward, charts a pioneering course for the next era of RPI.

### Our Vision and Roadmap for the Future

By 2034, RPI will redefine education and research in the fields of science and technology.

## Our Core Values

When the experiment fails at 2 a.m. and your lab partner shows up with coffee, you discover what fortitude really means. We don’t just bounce back — we adapt, persist, and find new paths through problems that would stop others cold.

Our distinctiveness isn't polished or predictable. We're the ones who see solutions where others see impossibilities. We embrace being different.

Creativity lives in our hands as much as our minds. We don’t just theorize — we build, test, break, and rebuild until the idea becomes reality, often using whatever materials we can find.

This restless curiosity drives us to ask better questions, to collaborate across disciplines, and to stay confident in our abilities without losing sight of how much we still don't know.

The impact we create ripples outward. Discoveries that started here change how the world works, and innovations that began as student projects transform entire industries.

Excellence for us isn't perfection; it's the obsessive attention to detail that turns good ideas into great ones, the focus that sees projects through to completion.

We are a community of distinctively-wired minds who understand that the best solutions emerge when diverse thinkers work together.

Through partnership — with each other, with our neighbors, with organizations near and far — we multiply our capabilities and extend our reach, knowing that the challenges worth solving require more than any one person or organization can offer.

## Our Community

### Students

Students are the heart of our culture. They don’t just consume knowledge — they actively shape it. We address them as co-creators in their education, respecting their unique approaches to learning while challenging them to exceed their own expectations.

### Faculty and Staff

Faculty and staff are the architects of our culture. Faculty serve as both mentors and fellow explorers, bringing deep expertise while remaining curious about new possibilities. Staff provide the essential foundation that enables discovery to flourish. Together, they embody our principle of “challenging intentionally” by pushing students beyond their comfort zones while providing the support necessary for breakthrough discoveries.

### Prospective Students

Prospective students represent the future of our community. We seek those who are intellectually driven and want more than a credential — they crave transformation, impact, and meaning. We address them honestly about both the challenges and extraordinary opportunities that await.

### Alumni

Alumni are living proof of RPI’s enduring impact. They carry our experimental ethos into their careers and communities, continuing to solve problems with the resilience and creativity fostered here. We celebrate them not just as successful graduates, but as ongoing contributors to RPI's legacy of innovation and as bridges connecting our achievements to possibilities.

### External Collaborators

External collaborators extend our influence beyond campus borders. From industry partners to community organizations, these collaborators bring real-world context to our work and help ensure that our innovations address genuine societal needs. We engage them as essential partners in our mission to apply science to the common purposes of life.

# Naming Conventions

## Overview

We have officially adopted RPI as our primary institutional brand name. While our legal name remains Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, we are formally embracing RPI across the majority of our communications and assets. This change recognizes that RPI is not only how we see ourselves, but how the world knows us.

## Usage Guidelines

To maintain clarity and consistency in all communications, it's important that we are unified in how we refer to the university.

### Primary Usage

When referring to the university, the preferred names are Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute for formal contexts and RPI for general use. Using the full name or the acronym ensures immediate recognition.

### What to Avoid

Avoid using Rensselaer in isolation to refer to the university.

### Existing Names and Organizations

We recognize that some long-standing and respected organizations, buildings, and phrases, such as the Rensselaer Union, carry the Rensselaer name. Established naming conventions should continue to be used for the interim. A broader discussion regarding institutional naming architecture and conventions warrants further discussion and will be decided outside of these brand guidelines.

# Voice & Tone

## Overview

RPI’s voice embodies two centuries of experimental spirit while remaining grounded and approachable. RPI’s voice is distinct, shaped by a collaborative culture and a commitment to solving complex problems at the intersections of disciplines.

Collection of red and white printed RPI brochures spread on a table.

## Using These Guidelines

These guidelines define RPI's institutional voice, not the voice of any individual member of the community. When you write on behalf of RPI, you are channeling the voice of the institution itself, setting aside personal communication style to represent RPI's collective identity and values.

These are guidelines, not templates. Examples throughout these guidelines are fictional illustrations designed to demonstrate the principles in action. Use them to understand the thinking behind effective RPI communications, then apply that thinking to your specific content and context.

Adapt the tone while staying true to the voice. RPI's core voice traits remain constant, but expression should flex based on audience, medium, and purpose. A social media post celebrating a breakthrough will sound different from a technical research summary, but both should feel authentically RPI.

When in doubt, return to the core question: “Does this sound like the kind of organization we are?” These guidelines exist to help you communicate with consistency and authenticity as the institution, not to constrain creativity or force artificial language.

## Our Voice

### Curious

We approach every topic with genuine interest and inquiry. We ask “What if we tried this?” and invite others to explore alongside us.

### Humble

We are confident in our expertise but modest in our presentation. We let our work speak for itself rather than making grand proclamations.

### Genuine

We communicate with authenticity and sincerity. Our enthusiasm for discovery and innovation comes through naturally, not through manufactured excitement.

### Resilient

We demonstrate strength and adaptability when facing challenges. We frame setbacks as learning opportunities and obstacles as problems waiting for creative solutions.

### Offbeat

We embrace our uniqueness and are not afraid to show personality. We celebrate the unexpected connections and surprising solutions that emerge from our collaborative environment.

### Relatable

We maintain a down-to-earth appeal that makes complex ideas accessible. We position ourselves as approachable experts, not ivory tower academics.

## What Our Voice Should Never Be

Obvious: We avoid stating the expected or mundane. Instead of saying what everyone knows, we reveal what others have not considered.

Arrogant: We reject superiority or condescension in all forms. We share knowledge to build understanding, not to demonstrate intellectual dominance.

Pretentious: We steer clear of urban elitism or academic snobbery. Our sophistication comes through substance, not style.

Hyperbolic: We avoid over-the-top promotional language. We let the genuine excitement of discovery drive our enthusiasm rather than manufactured marketing energy.

## Overall Communication Principles

Ground all communications in evidence. Whether technical or accessible, avoid empty claims.

Show the journey, not just the destination. Acknowledge the process, iterations, and collaborative effort.

Connect to human purpose. Always tie work back to how it serves people and communities.

Own achievements without arrogance. Balance deserved pride with institutional humility.

Replace superlatives with specifics. Use concrete examples rather than generic excellence language.

## Examples

### Informal

#### Academic Program Description

Here you will debug climate models with environmental scientists, build AI that helps doctors interpret medical images, and create interfaces that make complex systems feel intuitive.  
The curriculum creates space for experimentation across disciplines. The technical foundation is rigorous — students master everything from theoretical computer science to distributed systems — but the applications stretch into territories that surprise even the faculty. The most interesting code does not just solve problems; it reveals even bigger questions.

Voice qualities: Curious, genuine (specific applications), humble (“surprise even us”).  
Tone variations: Future-facing, accessible, specific, human–technical balance, slightly informal.

#### Research Spotlight

When Professor Smith’s underwater robot kept getting tangled in lake weeds, her team did not see failure — they saw a design challenge. “What if we stopped fighting the environment and started learning from it?” she wondered.  
Six months later, their bio-inspired robot moves through underwater vegetation like a fish, collecting water quality data that was previously impossible to gather. The breakthrough came from an unexpected collaboration: biology students who understood how eels navigate, engineering students who translated that into mechanical systems, and computer science students who programmed adaptive movement algorithms.

Voice qualities: Resilient (reframing failure), curious (“What if…”), genuine (real challenges and solutions).  
Tone variations: Human-leaning, simple over complex.

#### Alumni Stories

Maya Polytechnic never planned to revolutionize prosthetics design. But when she partnered with local physical therapy clinics during her junior year, she noticed that traditional prosthetics focused on function but ignored the sensory feedback that makes movement feel natural.  
“At RPI, you learn to see connections others miss,” Maya explains. Her background in biomedical engineering, combined with coursework in cognitive science and materials research, led her to develop prosthetics that provide haptic feedback to users. Today, her startup is helping amputees regain not just mobility, but the feeling of touch. What started as a student wondering “What if prosthetics could feel?” has become technology that is reshaping rehabilitation medicine.

Voice qualities: Genuine (authentic story progression), curious (“What if…”), humble (no boastful claims).  
Tone variations: Authentic, future-facing.

#### Social Posts

When your 3D printer breaks, you do not buy a new one — you redesign the broken part and make it better. Peak RPI energy right there.  

Plot twist: the robotics club’s prototype escaped the lab and is now delivering snacks around campus. It was not programmed to do that; it just evolved. The community is equally proud and mildly terrified.  

Last night’s show in the Union was absolutely unreal. John Guitarman had a packed house wrapped around every riff — the vibes were strong.

Voice qualities: Quirky, genuine, relatable.  
Tone variations: Informal, specific, accessible.

### Formal

#### Convocation Ceremony Program

Today, we gather not just to mark another beginning, but to celebrate the spirit of inquiry that has driven RPI forward for more than two centuries. As students embark on their academic journeys, they join a community united by a simple yet powerful question: “What if we tried this?”  
The challenges facing the world — from climate change and health care equity to energy systems and the ethics of AI — demand the kind of creative problem-solving that emerges when brilliant minds collaborate across traditional boundaries. An RPI education prepares students not just with technical expertise, but with the resilience to tackle problems that do not yet have names.  
Students are invited to approach their studies with curiosity, to embrace the productive friction of interdisciplinary thinking, and to remember that the most meaningful innovations often emerge from unexpected collaborations. RPI is a place where engineering meets artistry, where rigorous analysis pairs with creative experimentation, and where each unique perspective contributes to a collective pursuit of knowledge.

Voice qualities: Humble (acknowledging challenges), curious (celebrating inquiry), resilient (preparing for unknown problems).  
Tone variations: Formal but accessible, future-facing, authoritative balanced with humble.

#### Grant Award Press Release

A collaborative team led by RPI's Department of Materials Science and Engineering has received a three-year, multi-million-dollar grant to develop bio-inspired materials that could transform renewable energy storage.  
The project brings together researchers from materials science, biology, and computer modeling to investigate how natural structures achieve remarkable strength and efficiency. “Nature has been experimenting with advanced materials for millions of years,” said Sarah Smith, Ph.D. “We are curious about what we can learn from those experiments.”  
The interdisciplinary approach reflects RPI’s commitment to tackling complex challenges through collaborative research. Graduate students work alongside faculty from multiple departments, while undergraduate researchers contribute to computational modeling and materials testing. Industry partners from the renewable energy sector provide real-world applications for the laboratory discoveries.  
This funding builds on RPI’s growing reputation in sustainable technology research and positions the Institute to address critical challenges in energy storage — work that could have significant implications for renewable energy adoption worldwide.

Voice qualities: Genuine (specific details and quotes), humble (learning from nature), curious (exploring natural experiments).  
Tone variations: Authoritative, specific, professional.

# Design Principles

## Overview

RPI’s visual identity operates across a thoughtful spectrum that determines when our brand supports content versus when it actively drives attention. This spectrum ensures our communications are appropriately calibrated for both content-focused contexts and attention-capturing marketing.

## Background ↔ Foreground

### Background

When our brand takes a supporting role, it provides elegant scaffolding while allowing people, research, and ideas to take center stage. The visual approach is refined, subtle, and professional — creating the right environment for serious work and meaningful content to shine.

#### When to use the Background Approach

- Formal presentations  
- Zoom backgrounds for professional meetings  
- Institutional communications  
- Any context where gravitas and formality are essential  

#### Visual characteristics

- Simplified color usage favoring black, white, and cool colors  
- Low contrast patterns that read as background elements  
- Clean, spacious layouts with ample clear space  
- Clear typography hierarchy that supports readability  
- Brand elements used as a frame, not as a central focus  

### Foreground

When our brand takes a hero role, it actively captures attention and drives engagement. The visual approach is dynamic, expressive, and eye-catching — perfect for breaking through noise and inspiring action in competitive environments.

#### When to use the Foreground Approach

- Social media and digital marketing campaigns  
- Student recruitment materials  
- Alumni engagement materials  
- Campus events and celebrations  
- Any context where you need to capture attention quickly  

#### Visual characteristics

- Full color palette activation, including vibrant combinations  
- High contrast patterns that read as foreground elements  
- Dynamic layouts and bold visual treatments  
- Layered typography that drives visual impact  
- Brand elements as a central focus with amplified scale and movement  

## Principles in Practice

### 01. Match The Context

**Content-first contexts (Supporting Brand)** — Think academic conferences, research presentations, or professional meetings. Your audience is already engaged and focused. The brand should create a distraction-free backdrop that lets the substance stand out.

**Attention-capture contexts (Hero Brand)** — Think social media feeds, prospective student outreach, or competitive marketing situations. You have seconds to make an impression. The brand should be bold, memorable, and immediately engaging.

### 02. People + Ideas First

**When representing people** — Always use real imagery over stock. Show genuine moments of collaboration, discovery, and learning. Whether background or foreground, avoid overly staged visuals that don’t reflect the RPI experience.

**When representing ideas** — Match the sophistication of your visual approach to the complexity and context of the concept. A research breakthrough can look highly technical in an academic paper (Supporting Brand) or dramatically visual in a social media post (Hero Brand).

### 03. Pattern + Graphic Volume

**Background applications** — Patterns should read as subtle texture or gentle fields. Individual elements should be small enough that they support rather than compete with content.

**Foreground applications** — Patterns can be more dynamic and prominent, serving as key visual elements that actively contribute to the communication's energy and impact.

## Authenticity Across the Spectrum

Whether supporting or hero, RPI’s visual identity should feel genuine and purposeful:

- Choose real photography over stock imagery when possible  
- Show actual student work, research, and campus life  
- Embrace the technical and experimental nature of what we do  
- Let the substance of our work inform the visual approach  

### Guiding Questions

When in doubt, ask yourself:

- What’s the goal? Supporting content (Supporting) or capturing attention (Hero)?  
- What’s the context? Formal academic setting or dynamic marketing environment?  
- Who’s the audience? Do they need to focus on substance, or do you need to break through the noise?  
- Does this visual choice reflect who we are as an institute and serve the above criteria?  

Once you define where your communications fall on the spectrum, your design will be more effective. For specific guidance on photography, patterns, or other visual elements, refer to the relevant sections of these guidelines or contact the appropriate team directly.

# Logo System

## Overview

Our logo embodies RPI’s commitment to precision, experimentation, and setting new standards. This is not just another logo — it is a flexible identity system that encodes the multitude of dimensions, domains, and real-world contexts of RPI’s research and education impact.

The RPI logo with an animated bar moving fluidly through multiple variants.

## Primary Logo

Examples of bar variants beneath the RPI logo.

The primary RPI logo consists of custom letterforms anchored by the bar — a variable element derived from the surveyor’s rod in the original 1904 Institute seal — which provides creative opportunities for contemporary expression.

The bar serves as both a visual anchor and generative canvas, capable of containing embedded meaning such as data visualizations, technical metrics, encoded language, or algorithmic patterns that reflect RPI’s diverse academic and research pursuits.

All variable versions of the primary logo can be used interchangeably unless they are designated for specific purposes. Example usage includes:

- Default application for all external communications  
- Marketing materials and brand touchpoints  
- Digital platforms and social media  
- Official correspondence and documentation  

### Primary Logo Composition

Demonstration of the careful spacing present in the RPI logo.

- The primary RPI logo was carefully redrawn from the Replica typeface.  
- The height of the bar matches the width of the lettering, and the spacing between letters matches the space between the letters and the bar.  
- The letterforms and bar must maintain fixed proportional relationships with no modifications to the spacing, sizing, or positioning of elements.  

## Lockups

Example RPI lockups at large, medium, and small sizes.

### What is a Logo Lockup?

A lockup is a standardized logo format designed to represent major, permanent university entities with distinct public-facing missions. These lockups maintain visual consistency while establishing clear institutional hierarchy.

The lockup system creates clear hierarchy while maintaining brand consistency across RPI’s diverse academic, research, and administrative units. All lockups are designed to work at large, medium, and micro scales depending on the space available.

### Structural Consistency

- Fixed spacing and proportional relationships across all lockups  
- Standardized format accommodates both short and longer organizational names  
- Measurement bar maintains consistent visual relationship to RPI letterforms  

### Specialized Formats

Additional lockup formats are available for specific spatial contexts including environmental signage, hardware applications, and constrained layouts where the standard format will not fit.

### Who Receives an Official Lockup?

- Schools  
- Academic departments  
- Major administrative offices  
- Institute-led research centers  

### Who Does Not Receive a Lockup?

Academic programs, temporary initiatives and campaigns, student organizations, or projects. These entities use the primary RPI logo separately alongside their name in approved typography.

For questions about lockup eligibility, please submit a ticket using the marketing and communications form found on the "Contact Us" page on the left-hand navigation bar.

## Logo Placement

Consistent logo placement creates visual order and strengthens brand recognition across all communications.

- Primary logo placement example  

### Primary Logo Placement

Preferred positioning is in upper-left or lower-left corners, but any layout corner works for the primary logo.

- Preferred lockup placements  

### Lockup Placement

Standard Institute lockups work best positioned in upper-left or lower-left corners of a layout.

- Example showing the dynamic lockup on a grid  

### Separate Elements

The primary logo and entity name may also be used as separate elements — not in a lockup — to act as a frame placed on a layout grid.

## Partnership Branding

Partnership branding occurs when RPI is involved with an organization or initiative — it is a participant, partner, or member — but is not the sole operator. There are two ways to display partnerships that depend on the nature of the relationship.

### Equal Partnership

RPI and IBM co-branding beside the IBM quantum computer on RPI’s campus. Example of equal partnership branding with RPI and Mount Sinai.

**Use case**  
RPI partners directly with one other institution on equal terms, which may include co-ownership of centers, programs, or initiatives.

**Example**  
The Center for Engineering and Precision Medicine, which RPI and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai operate jointly, sharing governance and resources.

- Logo: Use primary RPI logo with minimum size and clear space requirements.  
- Positioning: Partner logos are positioned side-by-side with equal visual prominence. Neither logo may be enlarged, emphasized, or positioned in a manner that suggests hierarchical dominance.  
- Size: All participating institutional logos must maintain similar optical sizing. This means visual weight equivalence rather than mathematical measurements, as logos vary in density and composition.  
- Spacing: Maintain a minimum clear space between partner logos, ensuring visual separation while maintaining cohesive grouping. Use the height of the letter “R” to guide logo separation and divider placement. Use the width of “RPI” to guide the height of the divider separating the marks, using a stroke no thinner than 1px.  
- Alignment: Align logos to vertical center.  

### Multi-Institution Membership

Example of multi-institution partnership branding with RPI and the New York Fashion Innovation Center partner brands.

**Use case**  
RPI joins a group of multiple institutions under one umbrella organization or initiative.

**Example**  
The New York Fashion Innovation Center, where RPI is one of several participating institutions. The Fashion Innovation Center's logo appears prominently, with RPI’s logo alongside other member institutions in equal sizing.

- Logo: Use primary RPI logo with minimum size and clear space requirements.  
- Positioning: Main organization’s logo appears prominently, all member logos (including RPI) appear smaller.  
- Spacing: Maintain a minimum clear space between partner logos, ensuring visual separation while maintaining cohesive grouping.  
- Alignment: All logos must align on a consistent baseline or be center-aligned vertically when logos vary in height proportions.  

## Technical Specifications

Primary and secondary logo and background color combinations.

### Clear Space

- Digital: minimum of 10px around all sides of logo  
- Print: minimum of 0.25 inch around all sides of logo  

### Minimum Sizes

- Digital: 60px width with solid bar  
- Print: 0.75 inch width with solid bar  

### Color Combinations

- Primary use: Black on white, white on black, and white on red  
- Limited use: Red on white, red on black, and secondary palette combinations that maintain accessible contrast  

## Don’ts

- Do not re-create or redraw the logo elements.  
- Do not change the proportions or spacing between elements.  
- Do not stretch or distort any part of the logo.  
- Do not add outlines, shadows, or visual effects.  
- Do not compromise legibility or accessibility standards.  
- Do not use colors outside the approved palette.  

The logo’s power lies in its consistent application. Any modifications undermine brand recognition and institutional authority.

## Examples

A large, red RPI banner hangs on a brutalist building.

- RPI logo on a silver caliper  
- RPI branded book lying on a blue surface  

A polished, red F1 car races to the left with RPI emblazoned on the side.

- Black and white RPI logo shown on an old school monitor.  

# The Bar

### The bar that anchors the RPI logo translates our exploratory approach and outlook into visual form. It’s literally a way to “set your own bar.” Both a technical signal and a creative canvas, it invites the RPI community to experiment, encode, and express how we measure and create impact.

This dynamic element signals that we don’t deal in static measures, but in the substantive work of trying, failing, learning, and building. The bar is where innovation meets intention, where individual experimentation drives collective progress.

---

## Philosophy

“What if we tried this?” This question drives every great breakthrough, every innovative solution, every moment of discovery. The bar embodies this experimental spirit, providing a framework for creative expression while maintaining visual consistency.

- Music: scales, frequencies, tempo  
- Color: wavelengths, spectrums, codes  
- Distance: nanometers, miles, light-years  
- Volume: cubic liters, feet, acoustics  
- Location: latitude, longitude, elevation  
- Speed: milliseconds, cycles, centuries  
- Temperature: Fahrenheit, Kelvin, thermal  
- Pressure: PSI, compression, atmospheric  
- Weight: grams, molecular mass, load  
- Light: lumens, wavelength, aperture  
- Power: watts, resistance, torque  
- Hardness: Mohs, tensile, durability  
- Energy: joules, efficiency, kinetic  

---

## Creative Territories

Each bar is a programmable space of `500 × 36px` that encodes an idea. It can be generated by code, drawn by hand, or derived from data. What matters is the blend of rigor and imagination, logic and expression. The following categories are a starting point for exploration — not limitation.

### Number-01 — Binary + Encoding

Use systems of logic to encode identity.

- Binary/ASCII bars: Encode text or names as `0`s and `1`s  
- Hexadecimal stripes: Color-coded, width-based representation  
- Checksum patterns: Aesthetically symmetrical validation bars  

### Number-02 — Musical + Rhythmic

Translate sound and time into visuals.

- Staff notation: Encode melodies or sequences  
- Waveforms: Pull data from audio files to visualize amplitude  
- Step sequencers: Simulate drum machines or rhythmic grids  

### Number-03 — Data + Visualization

Use real-world data to create visual logic.

- Sensor streams: Accelerometers, temperature logs, lab equipment  
- Time series: Weather, solar output, historical campus activity  
- Graph-based logic: Bar heights representing clustering or distribution  

### Number-04 — Mathematical + Geometric

Visualize the beauty of math.

- Triangulations: Voronoi, Delaunay, or other meshes  
- Fibonacci spacing: Use ratios to structure shapes or spacing  
- Fractals and recursion: Mandelbrot-inspired visual complexity  

### Number-05 — Mechanical + Structural

Use visual logic inspired by machines and systems.

- Pulse diagrams: Simulate signals from circuits or sensors  
- Rulers/calipers: Visualize measurements, tolerances, or time  
- Assembly patterns: Create exploded diagrams or mesh grids  

### Number-06 — What Else?

These are just a starting point for creative exploration. There are no limits to the conceptual encoding — as long as you follow the laws of the bar. What might you encode in yours?

---

## The Laws of the Bar

- Only use primitive geometries (geometric shapes such as squares, ellipses, polygons, and lines).  
- Complexity increases minimum size (more complex bars should be used at larger sizes).  
- Maintain exact size and placement of the RPI logo in relation to the bar.  

---

## Guidelines for Student Clubs

Student clubs are encouraged to experiment and create their own bars. The same core rules apply, but there is also space to push them. Clubs can include additional color in the bar for their own usage, but only black and white versions will be accepted in the official logo library. The rest of the guidelines still apply:

- Make it mean something for your club  
- Use only vector formats (`SVG` preferred)  
- Use only primitive geometries  
- The bar fits in a `500px × 36px` rectangle  
- Maintain legibility and precise positioning beneath RPI lettering  
- No imagery or alphanumeric characters  

Student Union approval is required for internal club use. Formal brand approval is only necessary if a bar is submitted for inclusion in the official library.

# Seal

### The Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute seal serves as the most formal mark of authentication, reserved for occasions requiring the highest level of institutional gravitas and authority.

- The words Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute encircle a red, white, blue, and gold shield.  
- The words "Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute" encircle the black and white Rensselaer shield, with decorative tick marks separating the words from the shield.

**University seals exist to authenticate** — to formally validate documents and ceremonies with institutional authority.  
RPI’s seal, rooted in a 200-year heritage, carries the weight of tradition and the responsibility of official representation.

**The seal is not a logo.**  
It is a mark of authentication that validates the most important moments in institutional life such as graduation, formal recognition, and official documentation.  
Its power lies in restraint, and by reserving it for moments of true institutional significance, its authority and meaning are preserved.

---

## Approved Usage

The seal is reserved for the most formal and official applications.

### Primary Applications

- Diplomas and academic certificates  
- Commencement programs and ceremonial materials  
- Official university contracts and legal documents  
- Awards and recognition certificates of institutional significance  

### Ceremonial Applications

- Presidential podium and formal speaking occasions  
- Board of Trustees materials and official governance documents  
- Institutional dedications and cornerstone ceremonies  
- Official university regalia and academic dress  

All seal usage requires prior approval.  
The seal should never appear alongside commercial applications, promotional materials, or casual communications.

### Requesting Seal Usage

- Include context, audience, and intended use.  
- Allow a minimum of 10 business days for review.  
- Obtain written approval before production.

---

## Technical Specifications

### Minimum Size Requirements

- Print: `1.5"` diameter minimum  
- Digital: `150px` diameter minimum  
- Embossed: `2"` diameter minimum  

### Color Variations

- Single color: black, white, or institutional red only  
- Embossed: gold foil or blind emboss for premium applications  

The seal and primary RPI logo share a meaningful semiotic connection while serving distinct institutional purposes.  
The surveyor’s rod — central to the 1904 seal design — inspired the measurement bar system in the contemporary RPI logo, creating continuity between formal authentication and daily brand expression.

The radial tick marks in the updated seal echo the linear measurement system of the primary logo, creating a cohesive visual language that spans from ceremonial gravitas to modern communication.  

- Seal: authentication, ceremony, official documentation  
- Logo: communication, brand recognition, daily operations  

This shared visual heritage ensures institutional continuity while allowing each mark to fulfill its specific role.  
When both appear in the same application (such as Commencement materials), their relationship reinforces RPI’s commitment to precision, measurement, and technical excellence across contexts.

---

## Don’ts

- Don’t use the seal for marketing or promotional materials.  
- Don’t combine the seal with the primary logo lockup.  
- Don’t use the seal below minimum size requirements.  
- Don’t apply the seal to merchandise or casual communications.  
- Don’t modify the seal design or proportions.  
- Don’t modify the colors for the seal.  
- Don’t use the seal without obtaining approval from the President’s Office.  

# Color

### Our color system is built on institutional heritage while prioritizing clarity, accessibility, and purposeful application. The palette draws from RPI’s historic 1904 seal, establishing a foundation that honors our past and supporting modern communication needs.

---

## Primary Colors

Our primary palette establishes RPI’s visual foundation with black, white, and red as the institutional core. This restrained approach ensures maximum impact when color is applied purposefully.

## The Role of Red

Red is one of RPI’s most powerful brand assets — and our most easily misused. When applied thoughtfully, red creates energy, commands attention, and reinforces institutional pride. When overused, it overwhelms content and diminishes user experience.

Red should energize, not dominate. When in doubt, default to black and white.

### When Red Works

- Activation moments: calls-to-action, interactive elements, navigation highlights  
- Athletic events: “Big Red Freakout” and spirit applications where energy is the goal  
- Ceremonial occasions: formal events, Commencement, and institutional celebrations  
- Accent applications: highlighting key information or creating visual emphasis  

### When to Reduce Red

- Content-focused layouts: when photography, student work, or complex information is primary  
- Large background areas: red backgrounds can strain readability and accessibility  
- Interface-heavy applications: where user experience requires visual calm  
- Text applications: except for very specific emphasis or links  

---

## Secondary Colors

Our secondary palette introduces blue and gold — the primary colors that form the foundation of all color creation. These accent colors, from which we also derive our silver and gray, provide flexibility while maintaining institutional consistency.

### Secondary Color Values

- Silver  
  - HEX `#E1EDF5`  
  - RGB `225, 237, 245`  
  - CMYK `0, 3, 0, 4`  
  - PMS `642`  

- Gray  
  - HEX `#B9CCD8`  
  - RGB `185, 204, 216`  
  - CMYK `14, 6, 0, 15`  
  - PMS `643`  

- Blue  
  - HEX `#0081CE`  
  - RGB `0, 129, 206`

  - RGB `205, 172, 56`  
  - CMYK `0, 16, 73, 20`  
  - PMS `110`  

### Secondary Color Usage

- Bold brand colors (RPI red, blue, and gold) should generally be used as background color fills. Do not mix these bold brand colors together in a single composition. For a series, you can use different bold colors across individual compositions.  
- Use the neutral colors (gray, silver) to ground compositions and allow bolder brand colors to be used for emphasis.  
- Typography should generally be black and white for legibility, but bolder colors can be applied to small type and to create typographic texture in the background.  
- Do not allow the secondary palette to outshine the primary brand colors. Across RPI communications, use red as the dominant brand color, with blue and gold as supporting colors. While red should be the most frequently used and prominently featured brand color in the totality of RPI’s visual presence, individual compositions can certainly use blue or gold without red.  

---

## Color Accessibility

For digital applications, these color combinations have been tested to meet WCAG AA standards, with many exceeding AAA requirements. Only use accessible combinations to ensure text readability for all users.

### Color Accessibility Checklist

1. Use accessible color combinations only.  
2. Maintain WCAG AA contrast minimums (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text).  
3. Do not use color alone to convey information.  
4. Test combinations with accessibility tools when creating new applications.

# Typography

### Our type system embodies RPI’s technical precision and modern approach to education. By exclusively using sans-serif typefaces, we differentiate ourselves from common classical traditions of higher education. Type is how we visualize our voice.

Our type family consists of three carefully selected fonts: Geist is our default for clear communication; Geist Mono is for technical precision; and our logo is in a custom weight for Replica, which we also use for university-level marketing. Together, they reflect our commitment to innovation while maintaining exceptional legibility across all applications.

Note: RPI Geist and Mono are free to use and downloadable from the Font Library. However, Replica is a commercial font that requires purchasing a license before you can download or use it. If you don’t have permission to install fonts on your computer, please submit a Help Desk ticket.

---

## Geist

Geist is our go-to typeface for general communication. An open source font with Swiss DNA, it embodies simplicity, minimalism, and speed — values that align perfectly with RPI’s technical culture.

This geometric sans serif ensures clarity and readability across all platforms while maintaining the modern, technical aesthetic that distinguishes RPI from traditional academic institutions.

### Geist Usage

- Navigation and interface elements  
- Captions and supporting text  
- General communication materials  

### Geist Weights

- Regular or Medium: Primary weights  
- Bold: For emphasis  

---

## Geist Mono

Geist Mono reinforces RPI’s identity as a premier technical institution. This monospace typeface, originally designed for coding environments, brings texture to our communications while serving the practical needs of readability.

The choice of a coding-focused typeface underscores our deep connection to engineering, computer science, and technical innovation — core strengths that define RPI’s impact and experience.

### Geist Mono Usage

- Code snippets and technical documentation (14px and smaller)  
- Data displays and technical specifications  
- Captions for technical imagery  
- Applications requiring precise character alignment  

### Geist Mono Weights Available

- Regular or Medium: Primary weights  
- Bold: For emphasis  

---

## OpenType Features

We have modified the version of Geist in the Font Library — now named RPI Geist — to use alternate characters for optimal consistency with Replica.

If you are using the original font, enable Geist’s OpenType features using professional design software such as Figma or Adobe products, or with CSS using the `font-feature-settings` property. These features enhance typographic harmony and reinforce RPI’s technical aesthetic.

### Geist & Geist Mono Character Alternates

- No tail `a`  
- Alternate `l`  
- Alternate `R`  
- Slashed zero `0`  

---

## Replica

Replica is used for marketing impact and to announce our institutional presence externally. Built on a strict grid system, this bold sans serif creates a confident, technical presence. Its unique construction — with beveled corners and grid-based precision derived from an engineering challenge — reflects our technical and creative problem-solving mindset while delivering the authority needed for headlines and brand statements. The RPI logo itself is set in a custom weight of Replica.

Replica is a commercial font that requires a paid license and should be reserved primarily for high-visibility, university-level use.

### Replica Usage

- RPI logo and lockups  
- Key messaging and calls-to-action  
- Ceremonial and formal applications  

### Replica Weights

- Regular: Primary weight for most display applications  
- Bold: For emphasis  

---

## Usage Guidelines

### Size and Hierarchy

- Headlines: Geist or Replica (>36px)  
- Subheads: Geist (<24px)  
- Body copy: Geist (14px–18px)  
- Captions: Geist Mono (<14px)  

### The Three-Weight Rule

Limit yourself to three font weights maximum in any single layout. This constraint creates clear hierarchy while maintaining visual coherence.

- One weight for body copy (typically Geist Medium)  
- One weight for emphasis (typically Geist Bold)  
- One weight for hierarchy (typically Replica Regular)  

---

## Spacing and Alignment

### Line Height

- Display text (Replica): 110% of font size  
- Body copy (Geist): 140% of font size  
- Technical text (Geist Mono): 130% of font size  

### Letter Spacing

- Keep at default (0) for optimal readability  
- Replica can be tightened up to -2% for large display sizes  

### Alignment

- Always use left alignment for multi-line text  
- Center alignment only for short headlines or single words  
- Typography should align to an underlying grid system and maintain consistent vertical rhythm across layouts  

---

## Don’ts

- Don’t use Replica below 36px — it loses impact and clarity.  
- Don’t mix serif fonts with our sans-serif system.  
- Don’t use more than three font weights in a single layout.  
- Don’t set Geist Mono above 16px except for special display purposes.  
- Don’t compromise contrast for aesthetic preferences.  
- Don’t center-align body copy or multi-line text.  

Our typography system reflects RPI’s technical excellence and forward-thinking approach. By maintaining these standards, we ensure every communication reinforces our position as a leader in technological education.

font-family: "RPI-Geist", sans-serif;
font-family: "Replica", sans-serif;

# Pattern

### RPI’s pattern system extends the measurement bar’s creative logic into a flexible visual language that can scale across any application — from social media graphics to environmental installations. These patterns encode meaning through systematic approaches while maintaining the technical precision that defines our identity.

Red, white, and black bar patterns in square and circle cutouts form a grid.

---

## Philosophy

Patterns are the bar’s logic liberated from constraints — able to flow across any format, any scale, any surface.

They carry encoded information through systematic approaches: mathematical sequences, data visualizations, algorithmic generation, or purposeful randomization.

Each pattern tells a story through structure, whether it’s the golden ratio governing architectural proportions, Fibonacci sequences found in nature, or data streams visualizing campus activity.

The logic is embedded; the meaning is discoverable.

---

## Creative Approaches

Patterns draw from the same creative territories as the measurement bar system: mathematical and systematic logic, data visualization, algorithmic generation, and responsive systems.

These approaches can be applied at any scale or format to create meaningful visual expressions.

(See The Bar guidelines for detailed creative territories and examples.)

---

## Usage Guidelines

The EMPAC center, lit up from within during twilight, is overlaid with a smaller version of the same image with a bar cutout treatment.

### Flexible Applications

- Fill any shape: circles, rectangles, irregular forms, or complete canvases.  
- Serve as masks for photography and video content.  
- Layer over images to create depth and meaning.  
- Animate in motion graphics and digital displays.  
- Scale from thumbnail to building-scale installations.  

### Encode with Purpose

- Root every pattern in measurable logic: mathematical, scientific, or data-driven.  
- Document the underlying system — patterns should teach as well as decorate.  
- Consider viewing distance and context in pattern density.  
- Reinforce RPI’s values: precision, innovation, and technical excellence.  

### Visual Consistency

- Use only approved brand colors.  
- Employ only primitive geometries: rectangles, circles, lines, polygons.  
- Ensure scalability across micro and macro applications.  

---

## Accessibility

Be aware that some patterns can create moiré effects that may trigger seizures in people with photosensitive epilepsy (approximately 3% of people with epilepsy).

These effects are not a design defect; they are a well-studied mathematical and visual phenomenon that artists and designers often deliberately pursue for their striking impact.

While RPI’s patterns are designed to add visual impact, they should be applied mindfully by considering the audience and viewing context.

### Safety Considerations

- At small scales, screen display may increase moiré effects.  
- Consider using color combinations with reduced contrast.  
- Animation may amplify visual effects.  
- Overlapping patterns increase visual interference.  

---

## Don’ts

Patterns transform RPI’s spaces and communications into dynamic canvases that reflect our commitment to systematic thinking, creative problem-solving, and the beauty found in technical precision.

- Don’t create patterns without underlying systematic logic.  
- Don’t use photography, gradients, or complex imagery as pattern elements.  
- Don’t compromise accessibility or readability for aesthetic effect.  
- Don’t ignore scalability requirements across different applications.

# Video

Video is one of the most powerful tools we have to tell the RPI story. It allows us to move beyond claims and show the world the evidence of our impact. Our approach to video is a direct expression of our brand identity. It’s a tool for:

- Capturing our process of experimentation  
- Celebrating the journey of discovery  
- Showcasing our technical prowess  
- Highlighting the RPI community  

We embrace a flexible and authentic mix of video styles, from highly polished productions to raw, in-the-moment pieces that reflect the true RPI experience.

## A Mixed-Strategy Approach

A successful video strategy requires a mix of content types tailored to different audiences and platforms.

- Cinematic: Professionally produced videos for major announcements, handled by the internal RPI teams or external production companies.  
- Process-Focused: This is where our brand truly comes to life. Process-focused videos show our work in action — in the lab, the studio, and the field. They are transparent about process, highlighting collaboration and the messiness of innovation.  
- Community-Captured: Our community is invited to be co-creators and stewards of the RPI brand. This includes student and faculty takeovers on social media, raw footage from research projects, and quick interviews captured on a phone. This approach makes our brand participatory and authentic.  

---

## Core Principles for All Video

Every video, regardless of style or platform, should adhere to these core principles.

**Show the process, not just the result.**  
The most compelling stories are in the journey. Capture the moments of observing, questions, building, testing, and even failing. Showing the struggle and persistence makes the final success more powerful and authentic. But don’t forget the fun — the small talk, the not-taking-ourselves-too-seriously moments.

**Lead with human ingenuity.**  
Technology is our tool. People are our story. Focus on the faces, hands, and collaborative energy of our students, faculty, and researchers. Our videos should argue, visually, that we are a “human-centric technological research university.”

**Ground it in evidence.**  
Avoid generic claims. If a video is about groundbreaking research, show the lab and the equipment. If it’s about our collaborative community, feature real students working together. Let the video speak for itself.

**Design for the platform.**  
A cinematic brand anthem should not be crammed into a TikTok video. Always consider the viewing context, aspect ratio, and audience expectations of the platform where the video will live.  

Note: While these standards apply to all video production, it is crucial to recognize that content designed for authentic social media engagement requires a more flexible approach. The raw, immediate feel of a social post is often its greatest strength. The ultimate goal is to remain authentic to the platform and meet audience expectations, ensuring our content feels native and engaging rather than overly produced.

---

## Technical Standards

### General Guidelines

- Resolution: 1080p (1920x1080) is the absolute minimum. 4K (3840x2160) is strongly preferred to allow for cropping and future-proofing.  
- Audio: Clear, intelligible audio is required. Bad audio will undermine even the best visuals. Use external microphones whenever possible.  
- Lighting: Ensure subjects are well-lit. Use natural light when possible, but avoid harsh shadows or backlighting that obscures faces.  
- Stability: Tripods and gimbals are preferred. Deliberate, controlled handheld movement is acceptable for conveying energy or authenticity in social-first content.  

### Format-Specific Guidelines

#### Professional & Cinematic Productions

- Aspect Ratio: 16:9 landscape  
- Frame Rate: 24fps for a “cinematic” feel; 60fps+ for slow-motion footage  
- Color: Must be professionally color-graded to align with the RPI primary and secondary palettes.  
- Branding: Must use official, templated intros, outros, and lower thirds featuring the RPI logo and our brand type family (Replica & Geist).  
- Replica: Use for names and text content  
- Geist: Use for titles  
- Logo: Use primary RPI logo  

#### Social & Vertical Video

- Aspect Ratio: 9:16 portrait  
- Pacing: Fast and engaging; strive to hook the viewer in the first 1–2 seconds.  
- Subtitles: Subtitles are mandatory. A significant percentage of social video is viewed without sound. Apply captions using the RPI Geist typeface.  
- Branding: Use the primary RPI logo as end-card when a full intro/outro is not appropriate. Keep branding light and authentic to the platform.  

---

## Brand Elements

### Logo & The Bar

Use approved motion graphic templates for intros and outros. The bar can be animated to reflect data or concepts within the video — visualizing sound waves from an interview, showing lines of code, charting the process of an experiment, etc.

### Typography

All on-screen text must use approved brand typefaces: Replica for headlines and Geist for all other text.

### Music

All music must be properly licensed for the intended use. Choose music that reflects our brand principles — confident, inspiring, and an authentic companion to the context of the video.

## Video Editing Standards

### Pacing and Timing

#### General Pacing

- Maintain consistent pacing within each video segment to establish rhythm.  
- Standard interview cuts should be 3–4 seconds minimum unless intentionally creating quick cuts.  
- Allow speakers to breathe between sentences — don’t cut breathing spaces too tight.  
- For b-roll sequences, shots should generally hold for 2–3 seconds minimum.  
- Vary shot length to maintain viewer interest while avoiding jarring transitions.  
- Match the pace to content tone: faster for energetic segments, slower for contemplative ones.  

#### Interview Editing

- Use jump cuts sparingly — prefer covering with b-roll when removing pauses or segments.  
- When compressing dialogue, ensure natural speech patterns remain intact.  
- Maintain authentic emotional beats and reactions.  
- Leave brief pre-roll and post-roll on emotional statements to let them land.  
- Cut on action or natural speech breaks when possible.  

### Transitions

#### Standard Transitions

- Default to clean cuts — avoid overuse of transition effects.  
- Use dissolves sparingly and purposefully, typically 12–24 frames.  
- Reserve fades to/from black for opening/closing sequences or major scene changes.  
- Match transitions to the tone and style of content.  

#### B-roll Integration

- Begin b-roll slightly before or after the related audio for natural flow.  
- Ensure b-roll visually supports and enhances the narrative.  
- Maintain logical visual progression when sequencing b-roll.  
- Avoid cutting between similar compositions or angles.  

### Audio

#### Recording Best Practices

- Record in quiet environments: turn off fans or AC and eliminate background noise.  
- Use external microphones when possible (lavalier, shotgun, or USB mics beat built-in camera mics).  
- Record room tone (30 seconds of “silence” in each location) for editing continuity.  
- Keep consistent distance from microphone throughout recording.  
- Monitor audio with headphones during recording if possible.  

#### Audio Levels & Processing

- Normalize dialogue audio to consistent levels within each clip before editing.  
- Target -12 to -6 dB peak levels for final dialogue.  
- Match audio levels between different speakers in multi-person interviews.  
- Use audio compression to even out volume fluctuations in dialogue.  
- Remove background hiss and noise using audio cleanup tools.  

#### Mixing Multiple Elements

- Layer ambient sound beneath b-roll sequences for continuity.  
- Fade music appropriately under dialogue (-18 to -24 dB, not competing with voices).  
- Use music to enhance emotional impact without overwhelming content.  
- Balance multiple speakers so all voices are equally audible.  

#### Audio Transitions

- Crossfade between audio clips (minimum 3-frame overlap) to avoid clicks and pops.  
- Avoid abrupt audio cuts — use crossfades or natural sound bridges.  
- Match environmental sound when cutting between different locations.  
- Maintain consistent room tone under dialogue sequences to avoid awkward silence.  

---

## Narration

### Universal Best Practices

- Write for the ear, not the eye — use conversational language and shorter sentences.  
- Read scripts aloud during development to identify awkward phrasing.  
- Maintain consistent pacing and energy appropriate to content.  
- Use active voice to create engagement and forward momentum.  
- Include natural pauses and breathing space for complex information.  
- Match narration style to visual content — descriptive for abstract concepts, complementary for clear visuals.  
- Keep sentences under 20 words when possible for easier delivery.  
- Structure content with clear beginning, middle, and end.  
- Test scripts with target audience to ensure clarity and comprehension.  

### RPI Voice Integration

#### Approach and Attitude

- Lead with genuine curiosity.  
- Frame challenges as exciting problems waiting for creative solutions.  
- Show the journey of discovery, including iterations and collaborative processes.  
- Connect research and innovation to real human purpose and community impact.  

#### Language and Tone

- Replace superlatives with specific, evidence-based descriptions.  
- Use collaborative language (“we explore,” “our teams discovered”) that reflects interdisciplinary culture.  
- Maintain down-to-earth accessibility while respecting audience intelligence.  
- Embrace unexpected connections and surprising solutions with authentic enthusiasm.  

#### Content Structure

- Ground all claims in concrete evidence and examples.  
- Acknowledge the collaborative effort behind achievements without false modesty.  
- Connect current work to RPI’s rich history of innovation when relevant.  
- Balance deserved institutional pride with humble presentation — let the work speak for itself.  

#### What to Avoid

- Hyperbolic promotional language or manufactured excitement.  
- Academic jargon that creates barriers rather than builds understanding.  
- Obvious statements that don't reveal new perspectives.  
- Condescending explanations that talk down to audiences.  

---

## Visual Continuity

- Maintain consistent color grading within each piece.  
- Match lighting conditions between sequential shots when possible.  
- Ensure graphical elements (lower thirds, text) appear for sufficient reading time.  
- Follow established brand guidelines for visual treatment.  

---

## Time Management

- Honor attention spans with appropriate content length.  
- Front-load important information.  
- Build natural peaks and valleys in pacing.  
- End segments on strong visuals or statements.  

---

## Montage Guidelines

- Build sequences that progress logically and support narrative.  
- Vary shot types (wide, medium, close) for visual interest.  
- Match action or movement between shots when possible.  
- Consider pacing acceleration or deceleration for emotional impact.  

# Spirit Marks

These marks are used at certain events to embody RPI’s competitive spirit and school pride. They are designed to promote Institute athletics and generate community energy — not to replace our primary logo or represent academic programs.

---

## Athletic Marks

The RPI athletics logo splits the frame into thirds of black, white, and red.

“Rensselaer” and “Engineers” logos appear on black, white, and red backgrounds.

RPI’s athletic wordmarks provide bold, energetic branding for sports teams and athletic events. Available in both “Rensselaer” and “Engineers” versions, these marks create immediate recognition and school pride for athletes and fans.

### Athletic Marks Usage

- Team uniforms and athletic apparel  
- Sports marketing and promotional materials  
- Arena signage and venue branding  
- Fan merchandise and spirit wear  

### Athletic Marks Approval

Use of athletic marks must be approved by Adrian Donnelly, Assistant Athletics Director, at `donnea3@rpi.edu`.

---

## Puckman

Puckman is RPI’s hockey mascot — an anthropomorphic hockey puck wearing an engineer’s helmet. This character embodies the technical precision and competitive spirit that defines RPI athletics, particularly the championship hockey tradition.

### Role

Puckman serves as a rallying symbol for RPI athletics, bringing personality and energy to sports programs. This mascot complements — but never replaces — the primary logo system.

### Puckman Usage

With prior approval, Puckman is to be used only for youth apparel, special events, and hockey-related items. This logo is a stand-alone mark and should not be used in conjunction with text and other logos.

- Hockey-specific branding and merchandise  
- Athletic event promotion and fan engagement  
- Spirit wear and commemorative items  
- Social media and digital athletics content  

### Puckman Approval

Use of Puckman requires approval through the Athletics Department brand review process.
