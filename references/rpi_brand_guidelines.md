# About Our Brand

## Overview

Our brand encompasses the characteristics, beliefs, and standards that shape our identity and distinguish us from other institutions. Along with our students, faculty, staff, facilities, and alumni network, our brand is a competitive advantage that extends beyond visual elements to include our messaging and communication style.

Consistent application of our brand helps establish credibility with all our audiences and allows RPI's authentic differentiators and advantages to shine. It elevates and bolsters a culture built on our storied two-century history of innovation and excellence.

## Our Dynamic, Generative Identity

Various technical tools and visual patterns surround a surveyor's rod in the very center.

RPI’s new visual identity is not just a brand guideline — it’s a mindset. It’s an invitation to every student, faculty, and staff member to experiment. It’s an invitation to define success on RPI’s own terms. It asks a fundamental question that sits at the heart of invention: “What if we tried this?”

Our visual identity is a dynamic tool. It does more than claim value; it inspires the community to create it. It draws inspiration from a versatile system of metrics that symbolize the multitude of dimensions, domains, and real-world contexts of RPI’s research and education impact.

These are the four key design principles that define our identity:

### Dynamic

The identity adapts to different contexts while maintaining coherence.

### Participatory

It invites the community to contribute and co-create.

### Authentic

It accurately reflects our culture of experimentation and discovery.

### Distinctive

It sets RPI apart in a landscape of institutional sameness.

# Who We Are

## Section Overview

This section captures the essence of who we are as an institution — our driving purpose, our community, and the values that guide everything we do.

## Our Purpose and Vision

### Who We Are

Founded in 1824, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) is the first technological research university in the United States. We bring creativity, science, and technology together to address society’s greatest challenges.

### Our Purpose

We cultivate exceptional problem-solvers by immersing them in a culture of rigorous inquiry, disciplined practice, and hands-on application. Our strategic plan, RPI Forward, charts a pioneering course for the next era of RPI.

### Our Vision and Roadmap for the Future

By 2034, RPI will redefine education and research in the fields of science and technology.

## Our Core Values

When the experiment fails at 2 a.m. and your lab partner shows up with coffee, you discover what fortitude really means. We don’t just bounce back — we adapt, persist, and find new paths through problems that would stop others cold.

Our distinctiveness isn't polished or predictable. We're the ones who see solutions where others see impossibilities. We embrace being different.

Creativity lives in our hands as much as our minds. We don’t just theorize — we build, test, break, and rebuild until the idea becomes reality, often using whatever materials we can find.

This restless curiosity drives us to ask better questions, to collaborate across disciplines, and to stay confident in our abilities without losing sight of how much we still don't know.

The impact we create ripples outward. Discoveries that started here change how the world works, and innovations that began as student projects transform entire industries.

Excellence for us isn't perfection; it's the obsessive attention to detail that turns good ideas into great ones, the focus that sees projects through to completion.

We are a community of distinctively-wired minds who understand that the best solutions emerge when diverse thinkers work together.

Through partnership — with each other, with our neighbors, with organizations near and far — we multiply our capabilities and extend our reach, knowing that the challenges worth solving require more than any one person or organization can offer.

## Our Community

### Students

Students are the heart of our culture. They don’t just consume knowledge — they actively shape it. We address them as co-creators in their education, respecting their unique approaches to learning while challenging them to exceed their own expectations.

### Faculty and Staff

Faculty and staff are the architects of our culture. Faculty serve as both mentors and fellow explorers, bringing deep expertise while remaining curious about new possibilities. Staff provide the essential foundation that enables discovery to flourish. Together, they embody our principle of “challenging intentionally” by pushing students beyond their comfort zones while providing the support necessary for breakthrough discoveries.

### Prospective Students

Prospective students represent the future of our community. We seek those who are intellectually driven and want more than a credential — they crave transformation, impact, and meaning. We address them honestly about both the challenges and extraordinary opportunities that await.

### Alumni

Alumni are living proof of RPI’s enduring impact. They carry our experimental ethos into their careers and communities, continuing to solve problems with the resilience and creativity fostered here. We celebrate them not just as successful graduates, but as ongoing contributors to RPI's legacy of innovation and as bridges connecting our achievements to possibilities.

### External Collaborators

External collaborators extend our influence beyond campus borders. From industry partners to community organizations, these collaborators bring real-world context to our work and help ensure that our innovations address genuine societal needs. We engage them as essential partners in our mission to apply science to the common purposes of life.

# Naming Conventions

## Overview

We have officially adopted RPI as our primary institutional brand name. While our legal name remains Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, we are formally embracing RPI across the majority of our communications and assets. This change recognizes that RPI is not only how we see ourselves, but how the world knows us.

## Usage Guidelines

To maintain clarity and consistency in all communications, it's important that we are unified in how we refer to the university.

### Primary Usage

When referring to the university, the preferred names are Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute for formal contexts and RPI for general use. Using the full name or the acronym ensures immediate recognition.

### What to Avoid

Avoid using Rensselaer in isolation to refer to the university.

### Existing Names and Organizations

We recognize that some long-standing and respected organizations, buildings, and phrases, such as the Rensselaer Union, carry the Rensselaer name. Established naming conventions should continue to be used for the interim. A broader discussion regarding institutional naming architecture and conventions warrants further discussion and will be decided outside of these brand guidelines.

# Voice & Tone

## Overview

RPI’s voice embodies two centuries of experimental spirit while remaining grounded and approachable. RPI’s voice is distinct, shaped by a collaborative culture and a commitment to solving complex problems at the intersections of disciplines.

Collection of red and white printed RPI brochures spread on a table.

## Using These Guidelines

These guidelines define RPI's institutional voice, not the voice of any individual member of the community. When you write on behalf of RPI, you are channeling the voice of the institution itself, setting aside personal communication style to represent RPI's collective identity and values.

These are guidelines, not templates. Examples throughout these guidelines are fictional illustrations designed to demonstrate the principles in action. Use them to understand the thinking behind effective RPI communications, then apply that thinking to your specific content and context.

Adapt the tone while staying true to the voice. RPI's core voice traits remain constant, but expression should flex based on audience, medium, and purpose. A social media post celebrating a breakthrough will sound different from a technical research summary, but both should feel authentically RPI.

When in doubt, return to the core question: “Does this sound like the kind of organization we are?” These guidelines exist to help you communicate with consistency and authenticity as the institution, not to constrain creativity or force artificial language.

## Our Voice

### Curious

We approach every topic with genuine interest and inquiry. We ask “What if we tried this?” and invite others to explore alongside us.

### Humble

We are confident in our expertise but modest in our presentation. We let our work speak for itself rather than making grand proclamations.

### Genuine

We communicate with authenticity and sincerity. Our enthusiasm for discovery and innovation comes through naturally, not through manufactured excitement.

### Resilient

We demonstrate strength and adaptability when facing challenges. We frame setbacks as learning opportunities and obstacles as problems waiting for creative solutions.

### Offbeat

We embrace our uniqueness and are not afraid to show personality. We celebrate the unexpected connections and surprising solutions that emerge from our collaborative environment.

### Relatable

We maintain a down-to-earth appeal that makes complex ideas accessible. We position ourselves as approachable experts, not ivory tower academics.

## What Our Voice Should Never Be

Obvious: We avoid stating the expected or mundane. Instead of saying what everyone knows, we reveal what others have not considered.

Arrogant: We reject superiority or condescension in all forms. We share knowledge to build understanding, not to demonstrate intellectual dominance.

Pretentious: We steer clear of urban elitism or academic snobbery. Our sophistication comes through substance, not style.

Hyperbolic: We avoid over-the-top promotional language. We let the genuine excitement of discovery drive our enthusiasm rather than manufactured marketing energy.

## Overall Communication Principles

Ground all communications in evidence. Whether technical or accessible, avoid empty claims.

Show the journey, not just the destination. Acknowledge the process, iterations, and collaborative effort.

Connect to human purpose. Always tie work back to how it serves people and communities.

Own achievements without arrogance. Balance deserved pride with institutional humility.

Replace superlatives with specifics. Use concrete examples rather than generic excellence language.

### Informal

#### Academic Program Description

Here you will debug climate models with environmental scientists, build AI that helps doctors interpret medical images, and create interfaces that make complex systems feel intuitive.  
The curriculum creates space for experimentation across disciplines. The technical foundation is rigorous — students master everything from theoretical computer science to distributed systems — but the applications stretch into territories that surprise even the faculty. The most interesting code does not just solve problems; it reveals even bigger questions.

Voice qualities: Curious, genuine (specific applications), humble (“surprise even us”).  
Tone variations: Future-facing, accessible, specific, human–technical balance, slightly informal.

#### Research Spotlight

When Professor Smith’s underwater robot kept getting tangled in lake weeds, her team did not see failure — they saw a design challenge. “What if we stopped fighting the environment and started learning from it?” she wondered.  
Six months later, their bio-inspired robot moves through underwater vegetation like a fish, collecting water quality data that was previously impossible to gather. The breakthrough came from an unexpected collaboration: biology students who understood how eels navigate, engineering students who translated that into mechanical systems, and computer science students who programmed adaptive movement algorithms.

Voice qualities: Resilient (reframing failure), curious (“What if…”), genuine (real challenges and solutions).  
Tone variations: Human-leaning, simple over complex.

#### Alumni Stories

Maya Polytechnic never planned to revolutionize prosthetics design. But when she partnered with local physical therapy clinics during her junior year, she noticed that traditional prosthetics focused on function but ignored the sensory feedback that makes movement feel natural.  
“At RPI, you learn to see connections others miss,” Maya explains. Her background in biomedical engineering, combined with coursework in cognitive science and materials research, led her to develop prosthetics that provide haptic feedback to users. Today, her startup is helping amputees regain not just mobility, but the feeling of touch. What started as a student wondering “What if prosthetics could feel?” has become technology that is reshaping rehabilitation medicine.

Voice qualities: Genuine (authentic story progression), curious (“What if…”), humble (no boastful claims).  
Tone variations: Authentic, future-facing.

#### Social Posts

When your 3D printer breaks, you do not buy a new one — you redesign the broken part and make it better. Peak RPI energy right there.  

Plot twist: the robotics club’s prototype escaped the lab and is now delivering snacks around campus. It was not programmed to do that; it just evolved. The community is equally proud and mildly terrified.  

Last night’s show in the Union was absolutely unreal. John Guitarman had a packed house wrapped around every riff — the vibes were strong.

Voice qualities: Quirky, genuine, relatable.  
Tone variations: Informal, specific, accessible.

### Formal

#### Convocation Ceremony Program

Today, we gather not just to mark another beginning, but to celebrate the spirit of inquiry that has driven RPI forward for more than two centuries. As students embark on their academic journeys, they join a community united by a simple yet powerful question: “What if we tried this?”  
The challenges facing the world — from climate change and health care equity to energy systems and the ethics of AI — demand the kind of creative problem-solving that emerges when brilliant minds collaborate across traditional boundaries. An RPI education prepares students not just with technical expertise, but with the resilience to tackle problems that do not yet have names.  
Students are invited to approach their studies with curiosity, to embrace the productive friction of interdisciplinary thinking, and to remember that the most meaningful innovations often emerge from unexpected collaborations. RPI is a place where engineering meets artistry, where rigorous analysis pairs with creative experimentation, and where each unique perspective contributes to a collective pursuit of knowledge.

Voice qualities: Humble (acknowledging challenges), curious (celebrating inquiry), resilient (preparing for unknown problems).  
Tone variations: Formal but accessible, future-facing, authoritative balanced with humble.

# Design Principles

## Overview

RPI’s visual identity operates across a thoughtful spectrum that determines when our brand supports content versus when it actively drives attention. This spectrum ensures our communications are appropriately calibrated for both content-focused contexts and attention-capturing marketing.

## Background ↔ Foreground

### Background

When our brand takes a supporting role, it provides elegant scaffolding while allowing people, research, and ideas to take center stage. The visual approach is refined, subtle, and professional — creating the right environment for serious work and meaningful content to shine.

#### When to use the Background Approach

- Formal presentations  
- Zoom backgrounds for professional meetings  
- Institutional communications  
- Any context where gravitas and formality are essential  

#### Visual characteristics

- Simplified color usage favoring black, white, and cool colors  
- Low contrast patterns that read as background elements  
- Clean, spacious layouts with ample clear space  
- Clear typography hierarchy that supports readability  
- Brand elements used as a frame, not as a central focus  

### Foreground

When our brand takes a hero role, it actively captures attention and drives engagement. The visual approach is dynamic, expressive, and eye-catching — perfect for breaking through noise and inspiring action in competitive environments.

#### When to use the Foreground Approach

- Social media and digital marketing campaigns  
- Student recruitment materials  
- Alumni engagement materials  
- Campus events and celebrations  
- Any context where you need to capture attention quickly  

#### Visual characteristics

- Full color palette activation, including vibrant combinations  
- High contrast patterns that read as foreground elements  
- Dynamic layouts and bold visual treatments  
- Layered typography that drives visual impact  
- Brand elements as a central focus with amplified scale and movement  

## Principles in Practice

### 01. Match The Context

**Content-first contexts (Supporting Brand)** — Think academic conferences, research presentations, or professional meetings. Your audience is already engaged and focused. The brand should create a distraction-free backdrop that lets the substance stand out.

**Attention-capture contexts (Hero Brand)** — Think social media feeds, prospective student outreach, or competitive marketing situations. You have seconds to make an impression. The brand should be bold, memorable, and immediately engaging.

### 02. People + Ideas First

**When representing people** — Always use real imagery over stock. Show genuine moments of collaboration, discovery, and learning. Whether background or foreground, avoid overly staged visuals that don’t reflect the RPI experience.

**When representing ideas** — Match the sophistication of your visual approach to the complexity and context of the concept. A research breakthrough can look highly technical in an academic paper (Supporting Brand) or dramatically visual in a social media post (Hero Brand).

### 03. Pattern + Graphic Volume

**Background applications** — Patterns should read as subtle texture or gentle fields. Individual elements should be small enough that they support rather than compete with content.

**Foreground applications** — Patterns can be more dynamic and prominent, serving as key visual elements that actively contribute to the communication's energy and impact.

## Authenticity Across the Spectrum

Whether supporting or hero, RPI’s visual identity should feel genuine and purposeful:

- Choose real photography over stock imagery when possible  
- Show actual student work, research, and campus life  
- Embrace the technical and experimental nature of what we do  
- Let the substance of our work inform the visual approach  

### Guiding Questions

When in doubt, ask yourself:

- What’s the goal? Supporting content (Supporting) or capturing attention (Hero)?  
- What’s the context? Formal academic setting or dynamic marketing environment?  
- Who’s the audience? Do they need to focus on substance, or do you need to break through the noise?  
- Does this visual choice reflect who we are as an institute and serve the above criteria?  

Once you define where your communications fall on the spectrum, your design will be more effective. For specific guidance on photography, patterns, or other visual elements, refer to the relevant sections of these guidelines or contact the appropriate team directly.

# Logo System

## Overview

Our logo embodies RPI’s commitment to precision, experimentation, and setting new standards. This is not just another logo — it is a flexible identity system that encodes the multitude of dimensions, domains, and real-world contexts of RPI’s research and education impact.

The RPI logo with an animated bar moving fluidly through multiple variants.

## Primary Logo

Examples of bar variants beneath the RPI logo.

The primary RPI logo consists of custom letterforms anchored by the bar — a variable element derived from the surveyor’s rod in the original 1904 Institute seal — which provides creative opportunities for contemporary expression.

The bar serves as both a visual anchor and generative canvas, capable of containing embedded meaning such as data visualizations, technical metrics, encoded language, or algorithmic patterns that reflect RPI’s diverse academic and research pursuits.

All variable versions of the primary logo can be used interchangeably unless they are designated for specific purposes. Example usage includes:

- Default application for all external communications  
- Marketing materials and brand touchpoints  
- Digital platforms and social media  
- Official correspondence and documentation  

### Primary Logo Composition

Demonstration of the careful spacing present in the RPI logo.

- The primary RPI logo was carefully redrawn from the Replica typeface.  
- The height of the bar matches the width of the lettering, and the spacing between letters matches the space between the letters and the bar.  
- The letterforms and bar must maintain fixed proportional relationships with no modifications to the spacing, sizing, or positioning of elements.  

## Lockups

Example RPI lockups at large, medium, and small sizes.

### What is a Logo Lockup?

A lockup is a standardized logo format designed to represent major, permanent university entities with distinct public-facing missions. These lockups maintain visual consistency while establishing clear institutional hierarchy.

The lockup system creates clear hierarchy while maintaining brand consistency across RPI’s diverse academic, research, and administrative units. All lockups are designed to work at large, medium, and micro scales depending on the space available.

### Structural Consistency

- Fixed spacing and proportional relationships across all lockups  
- Standardized format accommodates both short and longer organizational names  
- Measurement bar maintains consistent visual relationship to RPI letterforms  

### Specialized Formats

Additional lockup formats are available for specific spatial contexts including environmental signage, hardware applications, and constrained layouts where the standard format will not fit.

### Who Receives an Official Lockup?

- Schools  
- Academic departments  
- Major administrative offices  
- Institute-led research centers  

### Who Does Not Receive a Lockup?

Academic programs, temporary initiatives and campaigns, student organizations, or projects. These entities use the primary RPI logo separately alongside their name in approved typography.

For questions about lockup eligibility, please submit a ticket using the marketing and communications form found on the "Contact Us" page on the left-hand navigation bar.

## Logo Placement

Consistent logo placement creates visual order and strengthens brand recognition across all communications.

- Primary logo placement example  

### Primary Logo Placement

Preferred positioning is in upper-left or lower-left corners, but any layout corner works for the primary logo.

- Preferred lockup placements  

### Lockup Placement

Standard Institute lockups work best positioned in upper-left or lower-left corners of a layout.

- Example showing the dynamic lockup on a grid  

### Separate Elements

The primary logo and entity name may also be used as separate elements — not in a lockup — to act as a frame placed on a layout grid.

## Partnership Branding

Partnership branding occurs when RPI is involved with an organization or initiative — it is a participant, partner, or member — but is not the sole operator. There are two ways to display partnerships that depend on the nature of the relationship.

### Equal Partnership

RPI and IBM co-branding beside the IBM quantum computer on RPI’s campus. Example of equal partnership branding with RPI and Mount Sinai.

**Use case**  
RPI partners directly with one other institution on equal terms, which may include co-ownership of centers, programs, or initiatives.

**Example**  
The Center for Engineering and Precision Medicine, which RPI and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai operate jointly, sharing governance and resources.

- Logo: Use primary RPI logo with minimum size and clear space requirements.  
- Positioning: Partner logos are positioned side-by-side with equal visual prominence. Neither logo may be enlarged, emphasized, or positioned in a manner that suggests hierarchical dominance.  
- Size: All participating institutional logos must maintain similar optical sizing. This means visual weight equivalence rather than mathematical measurements, as logos vary in density and composition.  
- Spacing: Maintain a minimum clear space between partner logos, ensuring visual separation while maintaining cohesive grouping. Use the height of the letter “R” to guide logo separation and divider placement. Use the width of “RPI” to guide the height of the divider separating the marks, using a stroke no thinner than 1px.  
- Alignment: Align logos to vertical center.  

### Multi-Institution Membership

Example of multi-institution partnership branding with RPI and the New York Fashion Innovation Center partner brands.

**Use case**  
RPI joins a group of multiple institutions under one umbrella organization or initiative.

**Example**  
The New York Fashion Innovation Center, where RPI is one of several participating institutions. The Fashion Innovation Center's logo appears prominently, with RPI’s logo alongside other member institutions in equal sizing.

- Logo: Use primary RPI logo with minimum size and clear space requirements.  
- Positioning: Main organization’s logo appears prominently, all member logos (including RPI) appear smaller.  
- Spacing: Maintain a minimum clear space between partner logos, ensuring visual separation while maintaining cohesive grouping.  
- Alignment: All logos must align on a consistent baseline or be center-aligned vertically when logos vary in height proportions.  

## Technical Specifications

Primary and secondary logo and background color combinations.

### Clear Space

- Digital: minimum of 10px around all sides of logo  
- Print: minimum of 0.25 inch around all sides of logo  

### Minimum Sizes

- Digital: 60px width with solid bar  
- Print: 0.75 inch width with solid bar  

### Color Combinations

- Primary use: Black on white, white on black, and white on red  
- Limited use: Red on white, red on black, and secondary palette combinations that maintain accessible contrast  

## Don’ts

- Do not re-create or redraw the logo elements.  
- Do not change the proportions or spacing between elements.  
- Do not stretch or distort any part of the logo.  
- Do not add outlines, shadows, or visual effects.  
- Do not compromise legibility or accessibility standards.  
- Do not use colors outside the approved palette.  

The logo’s power lies in its consistent application. Any modifications undermine brand recognition and institutional authority.

## Examples

A large, red RPI banner hangs on a brutalist building.

- RPI logo on a silver caliper  
- RPI branded book lying on a blue surface  

A polished, red F1 car races to the left with RPI emblazoned on the side.

- Black and white RPI logo shown on an old school monitor.
